**Vowel Counter Program**

This JavaScript program counts the number of vowels in a user-inputted sentence. It takes a sentence entered into an input field, checks for validity (ensuring it's not empty or just a number), and calculates the number of vowels using various methods. The result is then displayed, indicating how many vowels are present in the inputted sentence.

Key Features:
- **Validation:** Ensures the user inputs a valid sentence.
- **Flexibility:** Uses different methods (for...of loop, Array.from) to iterate over the sentence.
- **User-Friendly:** Displays the count of vowels in a clear and concise manner.
